************Trees***********


// Type Of Non-Linear Data-Structure

// tree which have atmost 2 child are called Bst;
// tree which have atmost n (unknown) child are called N-aray tree;
 
Node - 
Root - 
Parent -
Child -
Ancestor - 
Descendent - 
Siblings - 
Leaf -

for traversing - level order traversing ,  inorder , postorder , preorder , moris 

for craeting a tree : 
1) level order traversing
2) By recurssion
   (i) - create root Node
  (ii) - left wala reccusion for left side
  (iii)- right wala reccusion for right side
  

Balanced Binary Tree :
A balanced binary tree is a binary tree that follows the 3 conditions:
The height of the left and right tree for any node does not differ by more than 1.
The left subtree of that node is also balanced.
The right subtree of that node is also balanced


Types of trees :
1- Binary Tree
2- perfect(Full) Binary tree
3- compleate binary tree
4- Balanced tree
5- Unbalanced binary tree
