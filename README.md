## Array & Vector

An array is a fixed-size data structure that stores elements of the same data type sequentially in memory. It provides constant-time access to elements by index but requires predefined size allocation, making it inflexible for dynamic data.

A vector, often referred to as a dynamic array, is a resizable and more versatile data structure in many programming languages. It can grow or shrink as needed, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion of elements. Vectors offer the benefits of both arrays and lists, making them a popular choice for various applications.
